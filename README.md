## Description of the project:
- #### The IoT-based Smart Algaculture System will combine sensors such as soil moisture, rain detection, DHT11 and a water pump for automated irrigation. It also integrates AI for leaf disease detection, creating a smart system that offers precise and efficient plant care. The data from the various sensors is collected and analysed in real-time to enable immediate actions to maintain plant health and conserve resources.

- #### This project is for CPC357 (IoT Architecture and Smart Applications) only.
